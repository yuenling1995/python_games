simple games I wrote for practice

alien invasion - the classic arcade game with multiple game elements: ship shoot bullets to shot alien fleets and level up the game

balls - refined catch the balls: same catch game with more refined game elements (game level, current score, highest score, etc.)

sideway shooter - a ship that can move up and down & fire bullets horizontally 

rocket - a rocket that can be up/down/left/right with arrow keypresses

star - a grid of stars with random patterns of appearance on the screen

raindrop - a grid of raindrops fall steadily on the screen (a new row of raindrops reappears on top of screen)

catch - pikachu catching the ball falling from the top of screen

refined "catch the ball" game - hit the play button and play the game: pikachu can shoot bullets and has 3 chances to catch the row of falling balls

hit the target - (has play button) with a green target moving up and down on the right of screen, character (on the left) shoot bullets and attempt to hit the target
